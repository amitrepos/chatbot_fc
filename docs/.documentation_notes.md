# Documentation Organization Notes

**Created:** 2025-12-17

## Why So Many Documents?

**Issue:** Created multiple documents during planning phase, some redundant.

**Solution:** Organized into clear structure with README.md as index.

## Document Creation Policy

**✅ Create documents for:**
- Major phases (e.g., PHASE_7_USER_AUTH_PLAN.md)
- Architecture decisions (e.g., STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md)
- Step-by-step implementation (e.g., IMPLEMENTATION_STEPS.md)
- Project overview (PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, STATUS.md)

**❌ Don't create:**
- Redundant summaries of existing documents
- Temporary analysis that should be merged
- Duplicate information

**🔄 Merge when:**
- Information is duplicated across documents
- Quick reference can be part of main document
- Analysis is complete and should be integrated

## Current Organization

│   └── TESTING_PLAN.md
└── archive/
    ├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md        # Phase 1-6 (completed)
    └── NEXT_STEPS_ANALYSIS.md       # Superseded
```

## Cursor Rules

**No cursor rule forces document creation.** The `.cursorrules` file only says:
- "Documentation goes in /docs"

I was being overly thorough during planning. Going forward:
- Consolidate related information
- Use README.md as navigation
- Archive completed/outdated documents
